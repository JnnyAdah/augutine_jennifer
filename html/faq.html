                    What is YOBAI?
                </summary>
                <p class="text">Yobai is a web application that will be designed primarily for school proprietors of primary and secondary
                    schools in Abeokuta in Ogun state, Nigeria to enable them identify debtors before granting them admission
                    into their schools. This platform will also give access to parents or guardians to enable them challenge their 
                   debt status or make comments on the posts relating to them in the event that they were wrongly tagged as 
                   debtors. This idea is borne out of the need to assist school owners in tracking potential debtors and admitting
                   only those cleared of all debts into their institutions. </p>

        How do I contend a post?
    </summary>
    <p class="text">After signing up on the platform,
        a Parent/Guardian can add their children/wards if they were listed as debtors.
        When that's done, there is a button underneath the post, that reads "contend post".
        Submit the necessary documents to support your argument.
        Lastly, wait for comfirmation from the School.</p>
